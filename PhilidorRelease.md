It was headed as a Christmas release, and it contains the following changes:

  * Fixed a gtk/threading bug in loading files from command line

  * Fixed bugs in -, and improved logging
  * Cleaned up shortcut and accelerator keys

  * Made side panel hide properly in FICS games

  * Disabled sound availability test, as it produced false positives

  * Made load preview show the latest, rather than the earliest, position

As Tam√°s has found some pretty critical further issues, it might take one or two more beta releases before we can declare it final.

Also, the larger Philidor text-base isn't yet translated to near to number of languages that Greco had, so if you feel like it, head to https://translations.launchpad.net/pychess and make some noise!

However, merry Christmas, or happy holiday season to your all!

The long development time covers a close to total rewrite, the most throughout testing for a PyChess release yet, and a massive new base of features. Many of which users have been screaming since the first alpha of PyChess.

The new features includes, but are not restricted to:
  * FICS online Internet play.
  * Undo and pause functions.
  * Support for UCI engines like Fruit, Glaurung and Shredder.
  * Ability to turn analysers on/off, and to decide which engines should be used.
  * An "Enter game" in pgn dialog.
  * New fast start greeting screen.
  * A 30x faster built in python engine.
  * Internationalized or figure pieces in notation .
  * Optional sounds.
  * A comments side panel that helps you understand the moves made.
  * Pychess now use Launchpad Rosetta for i18n

It should be noted, however, that even though the FICS implementation is generally very stable, it hasn't yet got support for chatting and console communication. Thus it should be used with some care.

We encourage everyone to try out the release, and report the bugs (if any) you find.

And remember: "The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it" - Benjamin Franklin, 1779
