The Issues tab is a great way to keep track of the ongoing features, tasks, and bugs in your project. It allows multiple project members and owners to see what others are currently doing.

After you click the New Issues subtab to create a new issue, please note the Labels fields. Labels are strings that are meaningful to the project members. When an issue label contains a dash, such as 'Priority-Medium,' it is interpreted as a key-value pair that you can use like a custom field.

  * The prefix before the first dash is the key.
  * The part after the first dash is the value.

You can configure the issue list to show a column for any prefix. You can also search for the values within a specific custom field by using 'prefix:value.'
